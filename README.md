This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS related to the visibility of pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) within media queries.  The bug occurs when the parent element is not visible at larger screen sizes, and the media query targets smaller screens. The pseudo-element content may not be rendered even though the media query condition is met. The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a potential solution involving the use of visibility.
