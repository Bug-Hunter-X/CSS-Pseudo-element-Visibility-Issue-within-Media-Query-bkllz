One potential solution involves using the `visibility` property to ensure the parent element is visible even outside the target media query. Then, you can use the pseudo-element to display based on the `max-width` condition.

```css
.element {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  visibility: visible; /* Ensure element is always visible */
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element::before {
    content: "This text should now appear on smaller screens";
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use a separate CSS class that is toggled via JavaScript when the screen size changes and only apply the pseudo-element to that class. This approach completely separates the media query from the pseudo-element display.
